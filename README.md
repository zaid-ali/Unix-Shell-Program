# Project 03 - Unix Shell Program


### By Zaid Ali

#### 1) Project Description
This program is a  shell program that provides an interface for the user to execute commands. This program provides many functions present in a Unix shell environment, such as navigating directories, signal handling, and IO redirection.

#### 2) Acknowledgements
The sample code for reading a file and directory is provided by Dr. Bangalore.

#### 3) Getting Started

##### To compile the program
(no dependencies. All the code is in one file)<br/>
1) Download the project03.c file and the Makefile in the same directory.<br/>
2) Enter 'make' into the command line.<br/>

#### 4) Running test cases

1) Enter './blazersh' once compiled to run the program.<br/>
2) Execute any program through the shell, and then enter Ctrl+C on the keyboard to interrupt only the child process<br/>
3) Execute a program, then enter Ctrl+Z to stop only the child process<br/>
4) Now, enter 'jobs' to list the pid of the stopped process<br/>
5) Enter 'continue' to continue the program. It should execute normally<br/>
6) Execute a command with '<' or '>' to redirect the IO. eg './myprog arg1 arg2 < input > output'<br/>  
7) Enter 'quit' to quit program<br/>
8) Execute the blazersh executable with a list of commands (eg ./blazersh commands.txt) to execute the text in this file, line by line<br/> 
9) Enter 'cd <directory_name>' to change directory.<br/>
10) Enter 'list <directory_name>' to list the contents of a directory name.<br/>
11) Enter 'history' to list all previously entered commands.<br/>
12) Enter 'quit' to quit the program.<br/>
13) Any other program can be executed through this shell (i.e. 'uname -a')<br/>
